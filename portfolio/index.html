        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Growing up in a township, we were deprived of modern technological breakthroughs. I had always wanted to take a tech course in high school, like your CAT or IT, but my local school did not offer it, so I chose science studies instead. I can cook, use computers, and have AI essential career skills to mention a few. I enjoy playing basketball, taking walks in the park, and listening to music when I have free time. Yes, I adore tending to my grandmother's garden because it helps me feel a connection to the natural world.</p>
